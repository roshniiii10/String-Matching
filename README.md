# String Matching Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of classic string matching algorithms used to efficiently detect pattern occurrences within a given text. The project was developed as part of the **MA2233 Data Structures and Applications Lab** at **IIT Hyderabad**, under the guidance of **Prof. Vikas Krishnamurthy**.
